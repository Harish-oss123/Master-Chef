1. You will have to start the night before. In a bowl take fresh yogurt (curd), sugar, baking powder and all purpose flour (maida). 
Mix well all the above 4 ingredients.

2. Cover the bowl with a cloth or lid and set it aside in a warm place overnight or for 8 to 9 hours to allow natural fermentation to take place.
 The next day you will see tiny bubbles on the surface of the mixture. 

3.In another bowl, mix together the wheat flour with salt and rub the oil or ghee or butter into it with your fingertips.

4. Into this bowl, add the fermented mixture and the warm water.

5. Mix everything well.

6. Knead into a dough for 5 to 10 minutes or until it is smooth. Add a little flour if it is too wet.

7. Gather the dough into a compact ball and cover it with a damp cloth. Again set it aside in a warm place for 2 hrs. This is how the dough appears after 2 hours.

8. Knead the dough again. Shape into balls.

9. Roll each into 4 to 5 inch discs.

10. Heat oil or ghee and deep fry the bhatura in the same way as you would fry pooris. The oil has to be moderately hot.
 Use medium to medium-high flame while frying. When one side is golden, gently flip and fry the second side.

11.Fry them till golden and crisp. The bhatura will take a bit longer to fry than Poori.

12. Drain them on kitchen paper napkins to remove the excess oil.

13. Continue to fry each bhatura this way.

14. Serve the Bhature hot with Chana Masala or Amritsari chole or Aloo Chole.
 Also serve wedges of lemon and sliced onions along with the chole.
